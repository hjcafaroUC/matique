# matique
Matique is a utility/programming language to automatically generate solutions for dynamic programming problems-the ultimate goal is a programming language, and we're moving gradually toward that from our initial REPL system. 

# Details
Dynamic programming is a specific algorithmic technique for solving problems-the general idea revolves around dividing a problem into smaller subproblems, then efficiently calculating the solution to the subproblems and forming a solution to the larger problem. For more on this, see [Dynamic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) or any number of online tutorials. The idea of our language is to be able to concisely express a DP problem as a dp-space, a data-space, and a function to evaluate an answer.
