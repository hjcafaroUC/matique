# matiquepro
Automatically generated solutions to dynamic programming problems

# Details
The purpose of this project is to be able to quickly produce C++ code capable of solving dynamic programming problems. For more information on dynamic programming see: TOADD. The python program takes in details of the dynamic programming problem and automatically creates appropriate C++ code. 
# User guide
