# matiquepro
Automatically generated solutions to dynamic programming problems-the ultimate goal is a programming language, and we're moving gradually toward that through parsing text input. 

# Details
The purpose of this project is to be able to quickly produce C++ code capable of solving dynamic programming problems, in the context of competitive programming. For more information on dynamic programming see: TOADD. The python program takes in details of the dynamic programming problem and automatically creates appropriate C++ code-we are moving towards the python program just being a compiler of our matique code to C++. 

# User guide
The dp problem is specified as:
1. A data set (possibly empty)
2. A function to interact with the data set
3. A way to evaluate an answer
